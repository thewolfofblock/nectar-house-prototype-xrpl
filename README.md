Nectar House Prototype: Cultural RWA Tokenization on XRPL

## Overview
Nectar House is a curated marketplace for tokenizing cultural heritage artifacts as Real World Assets (RWAs) on the XRP Ledger (XRPL) Mainnet. This repo contains a high-level technical design, mock code, and plans for integration. The app enables fractional ownership, provenance preservation, and DeFi features like staking/auctions.

## System Design Diagrams and Narrative

### High-Level Architecture
- User Interface Layer: Web frontend for browsing/tokenizing artifacts.
- Backend Service Layer: API for logic/provenance.
- XRPL Integration Layer: Connects to Mainnet for NFTs/liquidity.

Technical prototype and design for Nectar House RWA tokenization on XRPL
Narrative: Users view artifacts in the frontend, which calls the backend to tokenize via XRPL. Data flows: UI -> API -> XRPL (XLS-20 for NFTs, AMMs for liquidity, Hooks for conditionals). Provenance stored on IPFS, linked to tokens. Future: Integrate EVM sidechain for advanced features.

## Code Organization
- /src/frontend: React components (e.g., ArtifactGallery.js).
- /src/backend: Node.js APIs (e.g., tokenization.js).
- /src/utils: Helpers (e.g., xrplMock.js).
- /docs: Diagrams, team, narratives.
- Modular for scalability.

## Libraries or Frameworks Used
- Frontend: React.js, Material-UI, Axios.
- Backend: Node.js, Express, xrpl.js.
- Storage: ipfs-http-client.
- Testing: Jest.

## Points of XRPL Integration
- XLS-20: NFT issuance for artifacts.
- AMMs: Liquidity pools for staking/auctions.
- Hooks: Conditional payments (e.g., escrow on bid win).
- Future: Credentials for KYC, XChainBridge for interoperability.
